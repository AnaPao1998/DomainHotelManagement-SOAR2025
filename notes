1. When creating new requests it has to match (???)

if you are making a new object in the project, every object should have a corresponding resource file,
should look like this:
Create a new ApplicationResource (Java Class)
"""
@ApplicationStateScope
- everything that happens inside this will apply/is accessible to anyone who tries to access the application

@ PostConstruct
- "once you deploy the server, run this"

@BankerResource (ex for other application, for us would be like Guest or Manager I think)
- put:
    @Inject
    - idfk why that's just what he said
    @GET
    - this does something lol but we still need to create functions to add/create/delete objects etc (add user, for example)

there are other scopes that
public

idk he stopped explaining here so this will not be helpful
